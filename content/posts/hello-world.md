## Building StreamWatch

For a while, I wanted a simple way to keep track of live streams without opening a browser and drowning in tabs. I also have a computer with old hardware. I spend a lot of time in the terminal, so it made sense to build a lightweight CLI tool that lets me manage and watch live streams in a clean way. Thatâ€™s how StreamWatch was born.
